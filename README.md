# BattleShip Java

---
## Introduction
This repository is my way of re-creating the popular game battleship in Java. 
The player is able to set up an (Y x Y) sized board, where the program will automatically generate random ship positions with 5 random ship types.
The player can then verse an AI-opponent, with a similar randomly generated map, and the two will have a amount of limited ammo to target and find their opponent's ships!

## Repository Navigation
Under src:
- "Main" contains the main program, setting up the boards as well as the intro screen
- "Ships" is the ship class which holds the information for each individual ship
- "MapArray" is the map class which holds the information for a map/board created for the player, as well as the opponent
